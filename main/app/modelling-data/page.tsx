    <div>I have strong data analysis and modelling skills, and I'm proficient in R and JavaScript.

    I began working with R to model mining data, finding the Tidyverse particularly effective for conceptualizing data modelling. Tools in RStudio allowed me to easily explore datasets and develop visualizations to better understand the data.
    
    I later transitioned to JavaScript to develop interactive models, utilizing libraries such as D3 and React.
    
    I also use Python, primarily for prototyping within Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks when experimenting with AI models.</div>
